## Introduction


## Development

### Authors

This is an open-source project by the **[Block Foundation](https://www.blockfoundation.io "Block Foundation website")**.

The Block Foundation mission is enabling architects to take back initiative and contribute in solving the mismatch in housing through blockchain technology. Therefore the Block Foundation seeks to unschackle the traditional constraints and construct middle ground between rent and the rigidity of traditional mortgages.
